# jq_cookbook
Here are my favorite JQ scripts for analysis and web-based testing.

## Installation

For Windows, clone the repo and set the PATH environment variable to point to it. 

That way you can run the JJQ batch file from the command-line, wherever you happen to be.

## Usage

```jjq <jq file> <optional parameter> <json file>```

*jQ file:* A file with the extension JQ from this repo.

*Optional Parameter:* Some of the JQ files, here take a parameter.

*JSON file:* Any JSON file you want to process.

You can also get a list of the available jq files by doing:

```jjq --help```

Each file is commented.
